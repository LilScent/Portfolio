## 1. FFBPNetwork - Forward Facing Back Propagating Neural Network
Located in f23_intermedpython
Folder contains the files I created for a basic node based neural network, included training data is the Iris Flower data set, network trains on a portion of the data
then can recognize and predict other flower types based on petal/sepal length and width.
